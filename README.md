## Usage

Hurry was developed with a modern JavaScript workflow in mind. To use it, it's recommended you have a build system in place that can transpile ES6, and bundle modules. For a minimal boilerplate that does so, check out [outset](https://github.com/callmecavs/outset).

Follow these steps to get started:

* [Install](#install)
* [Call](#call)

### Install

Using NPM, install Hurry.js, and add it to your package.json dependencies.

```
$ npm install hurry.js --save
```

### Call

Import Hurry, then call it, passing it the function to curry.

```es6
// import Hurry
import hurry from 'hurry.js'

// create a new curried function
const curried = hurry(function() {

})
```
